### About Me ###


I have a constant desire for self-development.


The developed semblance of perfectionism in me has both positive and negative sides. Meticulousness and precision prevail over speed and concentration over the main idea.


I often build strong foundations and walls where a simple staircase was needed.)


My new passion for Frontend opened a new world for me and gradually teaches me to perceive things easier.
